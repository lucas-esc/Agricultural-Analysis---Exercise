# Agricultural-Analysis---Exercise

Hi. This is an exercise that I did to train data analysis using Pandas.

In the first part I plotted two graphs showing how the planting of potatoes in Brazil has grown while the area used for cultivation has decreased over the years. This is possible thanks to innovations in the agriculture sector.

In the second part I generated a data frame and graph showing the total capital from agriculture of the top ten producing countries and their progress from 1961 to 2019.

I'm using a csv file disponibilized by FAOSTAT here: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data

This project can be found with the datasets in my Keggle profile here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lucasscaetano/agricultural-analysis-exercise/notebook
